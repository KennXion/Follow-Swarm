# Follow Swarm Project Status

## Current Date: August 24, 2025

## Project Overview
Follow Swarm is a Spotify growth platform that enables artists to gain followers through automated follow exchanges. The platform uses OAuth authentication, rate limiting, and queue management to provide a safe and compliant growth service.

## Completed Components

### âœ… Backend Infrastructure
- **Express.js API server** running on port 3001
- **PostgreSQL database** with complete schema for users, tokens, follows, analytics
- **Redis** for session management, caching, and rate limiting
- **Bull queue** for job processing and follow scheduling
- **Docker Compose** setup for all services

### âœ… Authentication System
- **Spotify OAuth 2.0** implementation
- Token encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- Session management with Redis
- API token generation for frontend auth
- Successfully authenticates users and saves tokens

### âœ… Core Features Implemented
1. **Follow Engine** (`src/services/followEngine.js`)
   - Rate limiting per subscription tier
   - Batch follow scheduling
   - Error handling and retry logic
   
2. **Queue Management** (`src/services/queueManager.js`)
   - Job processing with Bull
   - Priority-based execution
   - Automatic retries with backoff

3. **API Endpoints** (`src/api/`)
   - `/auth/spotify` - OAuth initiation
   - `/auth/callback` - OAuth callback handling
   - `/api/follows/*` - Follow operations
   - `/api/user/*` - User management

### âœ… Frontend Application
- **React + TypeScript** with Vite
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Routing with React Router
- Dashboard, Follow, History, Settings pages
- API integration with Axios

### âœ… Testing
- **63 tests written** (42 passing, 21 failing)
- Unit tests for all services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend component tests

## Current Issues

### ðŸ”´ Authentication Flow Issue
- OAuth completes successfully on backend
- User is created and tokens are saved
- **Problem**: Frontend redirect after OAuth isn't working
- After successful auth, user ends up back at login page
- Attempted solutions:
  1. Direct HTTP redirect - blocked by browser
  2. JavaScript redirect via HTML page - still not working
  3. State management via Redis instead of sessions

### ðŸŸ¡ Known Configuration Challenges
- Spotify doesn't accept localhost for OAuth redirects
- Using localtunnel (polite-wings-type.loca.lt) as public URL
- Tunnel requires IP verification on each access
- Cross-origin redirect restrictions between tunnel and localhost

## Environment Setup

### Required Services
```bash
# Docker services running:
- PostgreSQL on port 5432
- Redis on port 6379
- pgAdmin on port 5050
```

### Credentials (in .env)
- Spotify Client ID: dddc4f8cb72642c79ff5b06d90bc5ce7
- Spotify Client Secret: [configured]
- Redirect URI: https://polite-wings-type.loca.lt/auth/callback

### Current Tunnel
- URL: https://polite-wings-type.loca.lt
- Password: 73.103.231.11 (user's public IP)

## Next Steps to Complete

### Immediate Fix Needed
1. Resolve frontend authentication state management
2. Options to explore:
   - Use cookies instead of localStorage for auth
   - Implement a different OAuth flow (implicit grant)
   - Deploy to a real domain to avoid localhost issues

### Pending Features
1. **Subscription System**
   - Stripe integration
   - Tier management (Free/Pro/Premium)
   - Payment processing

2. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Growth metrics
   - Follow statistics
   - Performance tracking

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error boundaries
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry mechanisms

4. **Deployment**
   - Production configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment management

## How to Run

### Start all services:
```bash
# Start Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# Start backend
npm run dev

# Start frontend (in client/client directory)
npm run dev

# Start tunnel (for OAuth)
npx localtunnel --port 3001
```

### Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Technical Decisions
- Chose PostgreSQL for relational data integrity
- Redis for performance-critical operations
- Bull queue for reliable job processing
- Token encryption for security compliance
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4 for modern styling

## Lessons Learned
1. Spotify OAuth requires public URLs, not localhost
2. Cross-origin redirects are restricted by browsers
3. Session cookies don't work well across different domains
4. Tailwind CSS v4 has breaking changes from v3
5. Database migrations should run before starting the app
