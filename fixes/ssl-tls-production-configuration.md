# SSL/TLS Production Configuration Fix

## Problem
The application lacked proper SSL/TLS configuration for production deployment, running only on HTTP which is insecure for production environments handling OAuth tokens and user data.

## Root Cause
- No HTTPS server implementation
- Missing SSL certificate handling
- No HTTP to HTTPS redirect mechanism
- Lack of security headers for production
- No environment-specific SSL configuration

## Solution Applied

### Files Created:
1. **`ssl/ssl-config.js`** - Complete SSL configuration module
   - SSL certificate loading and validation
   - HTTPS server creation with TLS 1.2+ security options
   - Self-signed certificate generation for development
   - HTTP to HTTPS redirect middleware
   - Comprehensive security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
   - Environment-specific SSL configurations
   - Graceful error handling and fallbacks

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/index.js`** - Updated server startup logic
   - Added SSL configuration import and initialization
   - HTTPS server creation for production environment
   - HTTP fallback with security warnings
   - HTTP redirect server for production (port 80 → 443)
   - Environment-specific server startup logic

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Production HTTPS**: Secure server with TLS 1.2+ encryption
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **HTTP Redirects**: Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects in production
- **Certificate Management**: Configurable SSL certificate paths via environment variables
- **Development Support**: Self-signed certificate generation for local development
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: HTTP server if SSL configuration fails
- **Environment Awareness**: Different behavior for development/production/staging

### Environment Variables Added:
```bash
SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/certificate.crt
SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private.key
NODE_ENV=production  # Enables HTTPS mode
```

## Prevention Strategy
1. Add SSL certificate monitoring and renewal automation
2. Implement certificate expiration alerts
3. Add SSL configuration validation in CI/CD
4. Regular security header audits

## Result
- ✅ Production-ready HTTPS server implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive security headers configured
- ✅ HTTP to HTTPS redirect functionality
- ✅ Environment-specific SSL handling
- ✅ Development and production certificate support
- ✅ Graceful fallback to HTTP if SSL fails
