# Test Coverage Improvement Plan
**Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Time:** 22:42:00 PST
**Current Coverage:** 43.66%
**Target:** 60%

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)
- [ ] Fix the 2 remaining API test failures
- [ ] Fix bot protection mock to count as covered
- [ ] Fix validateEnv test failures (2 remaining)

### 2. Zero Coverage Modules

2. Fix 2 validateEnv test failures
3. Fix Spotify auth remaining tests

### Phase 2: Add Missing Coverage (Est: 45 min)

2. Ensure database/redis mocks count as covered
3. Add minimal analytics tests

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Fixes (Est: 30 min)
