## ‚úÖ Server Test Results

Started server successfully:
- Port: 3001
- Environment: development
- Database: Connected and validated
- Redis: Connected
- Queue Manager: Initialized
- Health Check: http://localhost:3001/health

### Issues Found:
- Bot protection table initialization failed (null query issue)
- This needs investigation but doesn't block main functionality

## üìã Corrective Actions Taken

1. **Started server** - Now running and tested
2. **Checked for existing processes** - Found MCP and Claude processes
3. **Creating continuous logs** - This document
4. **Committed and pushed changes** - Repository up to date
5. **Documented violations** - For future compliance

## üéØ Going Forward Commitments

I will automatically:
1. **Test every change** - Start server after modifications
2. **Update memlog continuously** - Document as I work
3. **Commit regularly** - After each completed module
4. **Break down tasks** - Clear numbered steps
5. **Check file sizes** - Refactor files over 300 lines
6. **Kill old servers** - Before starting new ones
7. **Follow ALL SOP rules** - No exceptions

## üìä Current Project Status

- Test Coverage: 43.66%
- Server: Running successfully
- Database: Connected
- Redis: Connected
- All changes: Committed and pushed
